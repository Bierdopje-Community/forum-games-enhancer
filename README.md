# Forum games enhancer **[IN PROGRESS]**
Creates an interactive scoreboard of the played game and adds a few enhancements

![Preview](http://eih.bz/s1/giftstl.gif)

Since the forum games at Bierdopje are one of the few active things
We feel they deserve a better way to manage the score.

This script aims to provide:
- [x] An interface where they can see the score per week or per month ( adjustable , so whatever )
  * New players can join with a score of `0` and still compete weekly / monthly.
- [ ] A notifier when someone answered in a topic you follow
 * [DM and/or frontpage]
- [x] An 'accept answer' button with each response.
  * You click it, and the scoreboard is auto-updated and pasted into the reply-box
